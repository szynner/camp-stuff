# 1 Expanded Information on Task 1: Using SSH Protocol

### Understanding SSH

- SSH, or Secure Shell, is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure data communication, remote command-line login, remote command execution, and other secure network services between two networked computers.
  
### Basic SSH Command Usage

- The basic command to connect to a server via SSH is:

```bash
ssh [username]@[server-address]
```

- Replace `[username]` with your user account on the server and `[server-address]` with the server's IP address or hostname.
  
### Examples of SSH Usage

#### Simple SSH Connection

- Example Command:
  
```bash
ssh john@192.168.1.100
```

- This command connects you to the server at IP `192.168.1.100` with the username `john`.
  
#### Executing a Command on the Remote Server

- Example Command:
  
```bash
ssh john@192.168.1.100 'ls -l /home/john'
```

- This command logs into the server and executes `ls -l /home/john`, listing the contents of the `/home/john` directory.

#### Using SSH with a Specific Port

- Example Command:
  
```bash
ssh -p 2222 john@192.168.1.100
```

Use the `-p` option to specify a port if the server's SSH service is not running on the default port (22).
