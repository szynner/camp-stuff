Exo 4


For Exercise 4 – Introduction, Task 1, you are required to write a Java function called `describe`. This function should accept an `ArrayList` of strings and print out each string along with the number of characters it contains.

Here's the Java code for this task with explanations for each line:

```java
Copy code
public static void describe(ArrayList<String> names) {
    for (int i = 0; i < names.size(); i++) { // Loop over each element in the ArrayList
        String name = names.get(i); // Retrieve the name at the current index
        System.out.println(name + " : " + name.length()); // Print the name and its length
    }
}
```
- Explanation:
    - `for (int i = 0; i < names.size(); i++)` {: This line initiates a loop that iterates over each element in the ArrayList `names`.
    - `String name = names.get(i);`: Retrieves the name located at the current index `i`.
    - `System.out.println(name + " : " + name.length());`: Prints out the name and the count of characters it contains. The `length()` method is used to get the number of characters in the string.

This function efficiently processes a list of strings, providing a simple but practical demonstration of iterating over an ArrayList and working with strings in Java.


**For Task 2** of Exercise 4 – Introduction, the objective is to rewrite the `describe` function using a `for-each loop`, which is a more readable and efficient way to iterate over collections in Java. Here's the updated function:

```java
Copy code
public static void describeForEach(ArrayList<String> names) {
    for (String name : names) { // Enhanced for loop to iterate over each element in the ArrayList
        System.out.println(name + " : " + name.length()); // Print the name and its length
    }
}
```
- Explanation:
    - `for (String name : names) {`: This is a `for-each` loop, which iterates through each element in the names ArrayList. It's more concise and eliminates the need for an index variable.
    - `System.out.println(name + " : " + name.length())`;: Inside the loop, for each name in the `names` list, it prints out the `name` and its length.    
  
This version of the function improves readability and is considered a more modern and idiomatic approach to iterating over collections in Java.

---

Task 3 of Exercise 4 – Introduction in the Java and Algorithmic module requires writing a `describe` function with a specific behavior. This function should iterate over an `ArrayList` of strings, which are presumably names, and print only those names whose length is greater than or equal to 4 characters.

Here's the Java code for this task with step-by-step explanations:

```java
Copy code
public static void describeNamesLength(ArrayList<String> names) {
    for (String name : names) { // Use a for-each loop to iterate over each name in the ArrayList
        if (name.length() >= 4) { // Check if the length of the name is 4 or more
            System.out.println(name); // Print the name if the condition is met
        }
    }
}
```

- Explanation:
    - `for (String name : names)` {: The `for-each` loop iterates through each name in the `names` list.
    - `if (name.length() >= 4)` {: This line checks if the length of the current name is greater than or equal to 4 characters.
    - `System.out.println(name);`: If the condition is true, the name is printed.

This function enhances the original `describe` function by adding a conditional statement to filter and display only the names meeting the specified length criterion.

---


Task 4 of Exercise 4 – Introduction in the Java and Algorithmic module requires creating a function named `to_upper_case`. This function should iterate over an `ArrayList` of strings and print each string in uppercase.

Here's the Java code for this task with explanations:

```java
Copy code
public static void toUpperCase(ArrayList<String> names) {
    for (String name : names) { // Use a for-each loop to iterate over each name in the ArrayList
        System.out.println(name.toUpperCase()); // Print the name in uppercase
    }
}
```
- Explanation:
    - `for (String name : names) `{: The for-each loop iterates through each string in the names list.
    - `System.out.println(name.toUpperCase())`;: The `toUpperCase()` method is used to convert each name to uppercase before printing it.

This function demonstrates how to manipulate and display strings in Java, specifically using the `toUpperCase()` method to change the case of the strings.

---

Task 2: approximation_fibo Function
```java
Copy code
public static int[] approximation_fibo(double epsilon) {
    int a = 0, b = 1; // Initializing the first two Fibonacci numbers
    while (Math.abs((double) b / a - 1.618033988749895) > epsilon) { // Check if the approximation condition is met
        int temp = a + b; // Calculate the next Fibonacci number
        a = b; // Shift the window
        b = temp; // Update
the new value.
}
return new int[]{a, b}; // Return the last two Fibonacci numbers that satisfy the condition
}
```
- Explanation:
    - `int a = 0, b = 1;`: Initializes the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
    - The `while` loop continues as long as the approximation condition is not met. The condition checks the difference between the ratio of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers (`b / a`) and the golden ratio (`1.618033988749895`), against `epsilon`.
    - `int temp = a + b`;: Calculates the next Fibonacci number.
    - `a = b; and b = temp;`: Updates the last two Fibonacci numbers.
    - `return new int[]{a, b};`: Returns the pair of Fibonacci numbers that meet the approximation condition.

This implementation of the `approximation_fibo` function effectively finds the point in the Fibonacci sequence where the ratio of consecutive numbers approximates the golden ratio within the specified error margin, `epsilon`.

Certainly! I'll provide a basic implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game in Java. This implementation will include a `GameBoard` class to represent the game board, a `Player` class to handle players, and a `TicTacToe` class to control the game flow. Remember, this is a simple version meant for educational purposes.

### GameBoard.java
```java
Copy code
public class GameBoard {
    private char[][] board;
    private static final int SIZE = 3;

    public GameBoard() {
        board = new char[SIZE][SIZE];
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                board[i][j] = '-';
            }
        }
    }

    public void printBoard() {
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < SIZE; j++) {
                System.out.print(board[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }

    public boolean placeMark(int row, int col, char playerMark) {
        if (row >= 0 && row < SIZE && col >= 0 && col < SIZE && board[row][col] == '-') {
            board[row][col] = playerMark;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    public boolean isWinner(char playerMark) {
        return (checkRows(playerMark) || checkColumns(playerMark) || checkDiagonals(playerMark));
    }

    private boolean checkRows(char playerMark) {
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            if (board[i][0] == playerMark && board[i][1] == playerMark && board[i][2] == playerMark) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    private boolean checkColumns(char playerMark) {
        for (int i = 0; i < SIZE; i++) {
            if (board[0][i] == playerMark && board[1][i] == playerMark && board[2][i] == playerMark) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    private boolean checkDiagonals(char playerMark) {
        return ((board[0][0] == playerMark && board[1][1] == playerMark && board[2][2] == playerMark) ||
                (board[0][2] == playerMark && board[1][1] == playerMark && board[2][0] == playerMark));
    }
}
```
### Player.java
```java
Copy code
public class Player {
    private char playerMark;

    public Player(char playerMark) {
        this.playerMark = playerMark;
    }

    public char getPlayerMark() {
        return playerMark;
    }
}
```
### TicTacToe.java
```java
Copy code
import java.util.Scanner;

public class TicTacToe {
    private GameBoard board;
    private Player player1;
    private Player player2;
    private Player currentPlayer;
    private Scanner scanner;

    public TicTacToe() {
        board = new GameBoard();
        player1 = new Player('X');
        player2 = new Player('O');
        currentPlayer = player1;
        scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    }

    public void playGame() {
        boolean isGameFinished = false;

        while (!isGameFinished) {
            board.printBoard();
            int row, col;

            do {
                System.out.println("Player " + currentPlayer.getPlayerMark() + ", enter row and column (0, 1, or 2): ");
                row = scanner.nextInt();
                col = scanner.nextInt();
            } while (!board.placeMark(row, col, currentPlayer.getPlayerMark()));

            if (board.isWinner(currentPlayer.getPlayerMark())) {
                System.out.println("Player " + currentPlayer.getPlayerMark() + " wins!");
                isGameFinished = true;
            } else if (isBoardFull()) {
                System.out.println("It's a draw!");
                isGameFinished = true;
            } else {
                currentPlayer = (currentPlayer == player1) ? player2 : player1;
            }
        }

        board.printBoard();
    }

    private boolean isBoardFull() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                if (board.board[i][j] == '-') {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
       

        TicTacToe game = new TicTacToe();
        game.playGame();
    }
}
```
### How to Run the Game

- Create three Java files: GameBoard.java, Player.java, and TicTacToe.java.
- Copy the respective code into each file.
- Compile the Java files using a Java compiler (e.g., javac TicTacToe.java).
- Run the compiled Tic Tac Toe program (java TicTacToe).

This implementation provides a basic console-based Tic Tac Toe game. The GameBoard class manages the game board, the Player class represents the players, and the TicTacToe class orchestrates the game flow. The program switches between two players, allowing them to enter their moves, and checks for a winner or a draw after each turn.

Feel free to modify and expand upon this code to include more advanced features like error handling, AI players, or a graphical user interface!






Exercise 2: Java Solutions and Explanations
1. Finding the Smallest Square Greater Than a Given Number
java
Copy code
public static int smallestSquareGreaterThan(int n) {
    int i = 0; // Initialize a counter variable 'i' to 0
    while (i * i <= n) { // Check if the square of 'i' is less than or equal to 'n'
        i++; // Increment 'i' to find the next square number
    }
    return i * i; // Return the smallest square greater than 'n'
}
Explanation:
int i = 0;: Start from 0 as we are looking for a square number.
while (i * i <= n) {: Keep looping as long as the square of 'i' is not greater than 'n'.
i++;: Increment 'i' to check the next square number.
return i * i;: Once the loop ends, 'i' will be the smallest number whose square is greater than 'n'.
2. Finding the Largest Square Less Than a Given Number
java
Copy code
public static int largestSquareLessThan(int n) {
    int i = 1; // Initialize a counter variable 'i' to 1
    while ((i + 1) * (i + 1) < n) { // Check if the square of 'i + 1' is still less than 'n'
        i++; // Increment 'i' to find the next square number
    }
    return i * i; // Return the largest square less than 'n'
}
Explanation:
int i = 1;: Start from 1 as 0's square is 0 and not informative in this context.
while ((i + 1) * (i + 1) < n) {: Increment 'i' as long as the square of the next number ('i + 1
') is still less than 'n'.

i++;: We increment 'i' to find the next potential largest square less than 'n'.
return i * i;: When the loop ends, 'i' is the largest number whose square is less than 'n'. The loop condition checks (i + 1) * (i + 1) < n because we want to find the point just before the square of a number exceeds 'n'.
These Java functions demonstrate the use of a simple loop and mathematical calculations to solve the given problems. The logic is straightforward and focused on finding the exact point where the square of a number meets the specified conditions (either just exceeding or just below the given number 'n').

Now Exercice 3 – Suite de Fibonacci, in the To do : part you have two things to do. Can you write the code for both ans of course your step by step comments describing each line of code
ChatGPT
Exercise 3 – Suite de Fibonacci, involves two tasks:

Creating a fibo Function: This function takes an integer as a parameter, representing the number of Fibonacci numbers to display. It returns these numbers in an integer array.

Creating an approximation_fibo Function: This function takes a floating-point number, epsilon, as a parameter, representing the maximum allowed approximation error. It returns the last two integers of the Fibonacci sequence that meet the approximation condition related to epsilon.

Let's write the Java code for these tasks with step-by-step explanations.

Task 1: fibo Function
java
Copy code
public static int[] fibo(int n) {
    if (n <= 0) return new int[0]; // Handle edge case where n is not positive
    int[] fibNumbers = new int[n]; // Create an array to store Fibonacci numbers
    fibNumbers[0] = 0; // First number of Fibonacci series
    if (n > 1) {
        fibNumbers[1] = 1; // Second number of Fibonacci series
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            fibNumbers[i] = fibNumbers[i - 1] + fibNumbers[i - 2]; // Sum of the two preceding numbers
        }
    }
    return fibNumbers; // Return the array containing Fibonacci numbers
}
Explanation:
if (n <= 0) return new int[0];: Handles cases where the input is zero or negative.
int[] fibNumbers = new int[n];: Initializes an array to hold Fibonacci numbers.
fibNumbers[0] = 0;: Sets the first number in the Fibonacci sequence.
if (n > 1) {: Checks if the array should contain more than one number.
The for loop calculates each subsequent Fibonacci number.
return fibNumbers;: Returns the array of Fibonacci numbers.
Task 2: approximation_fibo Function
java
Copy code
public static int[] approximation_fibo(double epsilon) {
    int a = 0, b = 1; // Initializing the first two Fibonacci numbers
    while (Math.abs((double) b / a - 1.618033988749895) > epsilon) { // Check if the approximation condition is met
        int temp = a + b; // Calculate the next Fibonacci number
        a = b; // Shift the window
        b = temp; // Update
the new value.
}
return new int[]{a, b}; // Return the last two Fibonacci numbers that satisfy the condition
}

Explanation:
int a = 0, b = 1;: Initializes the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
The while loop continues as long as the approximation condition is not met. The condition checks the difference between the ratio of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers (b / a) and the golden ratio (1.618033988749895), against epsilon.
int temp = a + b;: Calculates the next Fibonacci number.
a = b; and b = temp;: Updates the last two Fibonacci numbers.
return new int[]{a, b};: Returns the pair of Fibonacci numbers that meet the approximation condition.
This implementation of the approximation_fibo function effectively finds the point in the Fibonacci sequence where the ratio of consecutive numbers approximates the golden ratio within the specified error margin, epsilon.
